# String Percentage Formatting

# formatting from a set i suppose

# using index to format

# f strings

# curly braces can let you use variables of calculations or anything. content in {} is not treated as strings just know that much haha.

# adv lvl stuff in f strings not that much but i didnt knew if we can do this too lol ðŸ’€
subject = "interesting facts about the moon"
heading = f"{subject.title()}" # the subject string is being stored and tile method is being applied and you are storing a string in another var with f string formatting know that this is some out of the box stuff
print(heading) # printing heading now and one more f is not just used in print function ok
